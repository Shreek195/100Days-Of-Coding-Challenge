# 100 Days of Coding Challenge

Welcome to the **100 Days of Coding Challenge** repository! ðŸŽ‰

This repository is a personal journey of daily coding practice, where I tackle programming problems and challenges to improve my coding skills. Over the course of 100 days, I will be selecting random questions from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/SCR3AMxSK) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/SCR3AMxSK/) and providing detailed explanations for each problem.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Daily Problems**: A collection of coding problems solved each day.
- **Detailed Explanations**: Step-by-step explanations and walkthroughs of each problem to help you understand the solutions.
- **Code Solutions**: Well-documented code snippets and solutions in Python.
- **Learning Insights**: Reflections and insights gained from solving each problem.

## How It Works

1. **Problem Selection**: I randomly pick coding challenges from Codeforces and LeetCode.
2. **Solution Development**: I solve each problem and write clear and concise code.
3. **Explanation**: I provide an in-depth explanation of the solution, covering the thought process, approach, and any relevant algorithms or data structures.
4. **Commit Updates**: Daily updates will be committed to this repository, allowing you to follow along and learn.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by suggesting new problems, improving explanations, or providing feedback. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!
